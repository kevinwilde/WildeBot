# WildeBot

### To Do
* ~~Use Twitter Naive Bayes classifier~~ Makes app too big
* Move to postgres database instead of pickling files
* ~~import _ instead of from _ import _~~
* ~~Move host_ttt_game and host_mancala game to TTT and Mancala files?~~
* Handle each message in own thread? How would this affect if user sent a second move while bot was still thinking
* ~~Figure out how to put bayes in subdirectory/~~
* Change Mancala and TTT to quick replies
