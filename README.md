[This tutorial]
(http://tsaprailis.com/2016/06/02/How-to-build-and-deploy-a-Facebook-Messenger-bot-with-Python-and-Flask-a-tutorial/)
helped me get the bot up and running on Heroku.

The bot uses a Naive Bayes classifier to react to messages it receives. It also
can play Tic-Tac-Toe and Mancala. Think you can beat it?

### To Do
* Move to postgres database instead of pickling files?
